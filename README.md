# DEEP LEARNING and MLFLOW Experiment

### created a notebook to experiment MLFLOW and Tensorflow
#### I have used WineQuality dataset
####  Tried creating a deeplearning model using tensorflow and tried setting hyperparameter tuning using hyperopt
#### for learning rate and momentum for SGD optimizer and tried tracking the results in MLFLOW
#### for every unique parameter new experiment will be created and RMSE metric was tracked
